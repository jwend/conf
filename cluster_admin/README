This directory contains scripts used to setup NIS, NFS, ntp, and iptables on the bw01 cluster.

Please examine what each does before attempting to run them again, as they weren't necesarily all meant to be run more that once!!!

Some take arguments, some don't, and some may damage the cluster if run again. 

Their purpose was to automate configuration, and not for general admin use.
